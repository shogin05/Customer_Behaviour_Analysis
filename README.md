Customer Behaviour Analysis

ShopEasy, an online retail business, is experiencing a decline in customer engagement and conversion rates, despite investing heavily in marketing campaigns. The company has observed:
●	Reduced Customer Interactions: Fewer customers are engaging with the website and marketing content.
●	Decreased Conversion Rates: A decline in the percentage of site visitors making purchases.
●	High Marketing Expenses: Increased spending on digital marketing but without a proportional increase in revenue.
●	Customer Feedback Gaps: Poorly understood customer preferences due to lack of structured feedback analysis.

To address these challenges, ShopEasy's Marketing and Customer Experience teams have reached out for a data-driven solution that analyzes customer behavior, reviews, and journey patterns using SQL and Python.
